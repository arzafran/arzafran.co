      <h2>Thoughts on habituation</h2>
      <p><em>Habituation</em>... the word is pretty self-explaining, to make a habit from something, but my focus is on that <em>something</em>, it was something that once
      required all of our focus, our whole universe was around something that now is purely a reflex, an automated task.</p>
      <p>Our brains are amazing machines but they can only focus on one thing at a time, and by habituating stuff they're freeing up space to keep learning new things that require our whole concentration at least for a period of time, until it becomes a habit. But, I don't want my brain to make a habit from everything, and by feeding my creativity, questioning everything,
      and always trying to solve problems by disruptive thinking is how I try to deny that.</p>
      <p>This is a proof of concept. Just a way to say stuff, anything, <em>something</em>. :)</p>
